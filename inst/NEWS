Version 3.0.3 (2017-07) NOT ON CRAN

  o Add stopParallel() function to stop a cluster if parallel = TRUE, including
    registerDoSEQ() to avoid problems if foreach loop is used after.
  o A parallel cluster is automatically stopped unless a registered parallel
    back end is provided as argument to 'parallel' argument in the ga() or 
    gaisl() function call.
  o Bug fix in 'gaperm_Population()' when min > 1. Thanks to Romero Barata.
  o Update "A quick tour of GA" vignette.
  o Add README.Rmd that is shown in GitHub and CRAN.
  o Create a sticker for the package.
  

Version 3.0.2 (2016-06)

  o In interactive sessions use different monitor functions depending on whether
    or not is an RStudio session. This is due to different capabilities of the
    several consoles from which R can be run. 

Version 3.0.1 (2016-05)

  o doRNG moved from Depends to Suggests due to the unavailability of the binary
    version of the package on Windows. As a consequence, GA package can be 
    installed even without doRNG being installed, but in this case results are 
    not reproducible by setting the seed if GAs are executed in parallel.    

Version 3.0 (2016-05)

  o Added option to provide a cluster for parallelisation.
  o Added GA-hybrid using optim() for local search.
  o Added GA Islands model in gaisl().
  o Rewrite of gaMonitor() to clear the previous output before printing the 
    info about the current iteration. Old version is available in gaMonitor2().
    Same behaviour for gaislMonitor() and gaislMonitor2().

Version 2.3 (2015-07)

  o Added documentation vignettes.

Version 2.2 (2014-10)

  o Slight modification to plot method.
  o Included link in main ga documentation to genetic operators.
  o Added ga_pmutation() function to allow GAs having variable mutation 
    probability.
  o pdf files (previously included as vignettes) moved to inst/doc with 
    corresponding index.html.
  
Version 2.1 (2014-05)

  o .printShortMatrix is a function to print part of rows/columns of a matrix
  o print.summary.ga accept arguments to be passed to .printShortMatrix. This
    allow to shorten the printed output in case of large dimensions for the 
    matrices containing the suggestions and the final solutions.
  o plot.ga now shadowed the area between the max and the median of fitness values 
    at each iteration. Changed to pch from 17 to 1 for means.
  o Function gaSummary() is embedded in the code, so it cannot be defined by the user.
  o Added function ga_pmutation for computing variable mutation probability. 
  o Modified main function ga() to allow for pmutation to be a function. This enables
    the use of variable mutation rate.
  o Export plot.ga class in NAMESPACE and used as S4 method.
  o Computing summaries at each step is done by function gaSummary(), but it
    may be defined by the user.
  o Export summary.ga class in NAMESPACE and used as S4 method.
  o Default for suggestions argument in ga() is set to NULL.
  o Fixed a bug in gabin_uCrossover.
  o Added description of slots in the help page for ga-class.
  o Bug fix on setting maxfitness.
  o Bug fix on passing seed argument when "snow" parallel is used.
  o Add explicitly stop clusters if parallel is used.
  o Parallel computing improving set up of clusters.

Version 2.0 (2013-08)

   o Option for parallel computing.

Version 1.2 (2013-04, not on CRAN)

   o Added argument keepBest to include the best solution at each iteration.
   o Bug fix when using suggestions argument.

Version 1.1 (2013-04)

   o Update citation and references to JSS paper.

Version 1.0 (2012-06)

   o First release on CRAN.
